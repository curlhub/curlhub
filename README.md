### Welcome to CurlHub 👋️

[CurlHub](https://curlhub.io) was launched in 2018 to replace Runscope's beloved Traffic Inspector which was taken offline.

#### Good News

The free limit has been raised from 100 requests to 10,000! 🎉

That's enough to meet the needs of a lot of developers!

#### Bad News

We had two good years of paying customers and then the pandemic hit and we lost all of them. 😞

Since we never save your API requests, our costs our low, but we still operate at a loss as of Feb 2021.
